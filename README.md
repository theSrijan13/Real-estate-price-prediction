# Real-estate-price-prediction
This project aims to predict the price of real estate properties using various machine learning algorithms. The project uses a dataset consisting of information on various attributes of real estate properties.

## Installation

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
  
## Usage
Navigate to the project directory: cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Run the script: python main.py
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, train the model, and generate predictions.
The predicted prices will be saved in a CSV file named predictions.csv in the project directory.
  
## Dataset
  
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle. It contains information on various attributes of real estate properties such as location, number of rooms, area, etc. The dataset has 41503 rows and 8 columns.
  
 ## Algorithms
  
 This project uses the following machine learning algorithms to predict real estate prices:
  
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression
Decision Tree Regression
Random Forest Regression
  
## Evaluation
  
The performance of the machine learning algorithms is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) and the R-squared score. The algorithm with the lowest MSE and the highest R-squared score is considered the best-performing algorithm.
